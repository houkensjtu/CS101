> How to think like a compputer scientist <= 言い過ぎ

### Chapter 1 : The way of the program

- What is a program? 
- Running Python. (Used Python 3.4 vanilla version)
- First program (just print("hello world"))
- Arithmatic operations
- Value and types (can use type() to check the type of a value)
```Python
type(42)
#=> <class 'int'>
type('42')
#=> <class 'str'>
```
- Compare natural and formal language
- Debugging (Only introduced what is debugging; no actual debugging skill)

### Chapter 2 : Variables, expressions and statements

- Assignment statemet （create a varialbe and give it a value)
```Python
n  = 17
pi = 3.1415926
```
