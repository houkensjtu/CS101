## :snail: The Big-O notation

以下是一些我从不同的资源获得的关于Big-O的学习资料汇总。

### 1. [All you need to know about big-o notation](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-big-o-notation-to-crack-your-next-coding-interview-9d575e7eec4) 
这篇文章比较粗略，作为背景入门阅读不错。号称all you need to know绝逼是诈骗:sweat:。
- Software is heavily based on data. 
- Big O notation, sometimes also called [“asymptotic analysis (渐进分析)”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis), 
primarily looks at how many operations a sorting algorithm takes to completely sort a very large collection of data. 
(这个解释严格说太过笼统了)
- It does this with regard to “O” and “n”, ( example: “O(log n)” ), where
    - O refers to the **order of the function, or its growth rate**, and
    - n is **the length of the array** to be sorted.
- Example : f(n) = 6n^4 - 2n^3 + 5. When **n grows to infinity, 6n^4 is the only one that matters**. 
So the lesser terms, 2n^3 and 5, are actually just omitted because they are insignificant. 
Same goes for the “6” in 6n^4, actually. Therefore, this function would have an order growth rate, or a “big O” rating, of **O(n^4)**.
- The rating of **O(n log n) in general is the best** that can be achieved. 
Algorithms that run at this rating include **Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Merge Sort**. Quick Sort is the standard
- Bubble / Insertion / Selection Sort run at O(n²). ([这个网站](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)收集了一些最常见算法的时间复杂度并可视化成了图表.)

### 3. [Algorithm - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)   
Khan Academy在美国的人气挺高，亲眼看见过学生妹在Starbucks抱着Khan Academy在复习生物。于是抱着试试看的想法学习了Khan Academy的算法course
（不你这是哪门子的逻辑。。。）。学习了几章以后感觉课程的内容编排很合理，从介绍算法的背景，到简单算法的分析，从中引出了Big-O表示。
Let's get right INTO IT!(又来了。。）

#### Lesson 1 :smile: : Intro to algorithms
  
1. What is algorithm and why should you care?
  - Real world examples: Image compression for video chat; fastest route finding calculation in Google map; solar panel adjustment at NASA...
  - What makes a good algorithm : correctness vs. efficiency.
  - Tool for analyzing the efficiency: Actual runtime depends on machine -> **asymptotic analysis (渐进分析)**
2. A guessing game
  - Computer will pick a number between 1-16. You guess the number. (Computer will tell you too high or too low.)
  - Linear search : Guess from 1 all the way to 16. Takes 16 guesses at most and 1 at least, 8 on average.
  - Binary search : Guess 8 at first, then shrink the range every step. Should take 4 steps at most.
  - How many steps does it take to guess 1-300? A: No more than 9. Because 2^8 = 256, 2^9 = 512.
3. Route finding
  - Route finding can be found in many very different-sounding problems:
    - How is the current Prince William related to King William III?
    - What path should a ghost follow to get to Pac-Man as quickly as possible?
    - What's the best way to drive from Dallas, Texas to Orlando, Florida?
    - Exploring a maze : how to navigate to the goal?

    <p> A possible strategy: compute the distance from the goal for every cell, starting from the goal. </p>    
  -  The implementation of this algorithm will be discussed in later chapter (Javascript).  
4. Discuss: Algorithms in your life
  - Find problem-solving algorithm in your life.
  
#### Lesson 2 :laughing: : Binary search

1. Describing binary search
  - The key is to **keep track of the current range** of reasonable guess.
  - At each turn, choose a guess that **divides the range into 2 equal size parts**. Then, update the max/min bound according to the result.   
  - For example, suppose the current range is (26,80). Take the guess as (26+80)/2=53. If the result says 53 is too high, you assign max = 53. Thus, the size of the problem is reduced to half.
